# Oh

A [promptherder](https://github.com/shermanhuman/promptherder) herd — my personal collection of skills covering the tools, APIs, and patterns I use across projects.

**This is not a general-purpose library.** The skills here are specific to my stack (Phoenix, Telnyx, Tekmetric, etc.) and probably aren't useful to you directly. What _is_ useful is seeing how a herd is structured — if you want to build your own collection of reusable AI agent skills, this is a working example of how to do it with promptherder.

Named after [Sadaharu Oh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadaharu_Oh) — the greatest home run hitter in professional baseball history. 868 career home runs across 22 seasons with the Yomiuri Giants. If compound-v gives your AI agent superpowers, oh is the discipline and consistency that turns raw power into a record-breaking career. 王貞治.

## Install

```bash
# Install promptherder
go install github.com/shermanhuman/promptherder/cmd/promptherder@latest

# Pull this herd
promptherder pull https://github.com/shermanhuman/oh

# Sync to agent targets
promptherder
```

Files install to `.agents/` (Antigravity default since v1.14). Legacy `.agent/` is still read by Antigravity for backward compat — promptherder will prompt you to migrate when you next run it.

## What's Included

Skills covering the tools, APIs, and infrastructure patterns used across my projects.

## How it fits with Compound V

`oh` is a companion herd to [compound-v](https://github.com/shermanhuman/compound-v). Compound V provides the methodology (planning, execution, review). Oh provides environment-specific knowledge — the tools, services, and patterns specific to your infrastructure that every repo needs to know about.

```
compound-v  →  methodology (how to work)
oh          →  environment (what you work with)
stack.md    →  project (what you're building)
```

Pull both into any repo:

```bash
promptherder pull https://github.com/shermanhuman/compound-v
promptherder pull https://github.com/shermanhuman/oh
promptherder
```
