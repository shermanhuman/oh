API Overview
The Tekmetric API allows shop owners to grant read only access to their Customer, Vehicle, and Repair Order data to 3rd party applications through a RESTful web service. Our API uses resource-oriented URLS, accepts query strings, returns JSON responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

Authentication
The Tekmetric API uses access tokens to authenticate requests. You can obtain an access token and authenticate requests by following the steps below:
Complete the API Application form linked here. Once your application is reviewed, you will be contacted with next steps.
Exchange the provided Client ID and Client Secret for an access token using the Token Endpoint.
Provide the generated access token as the bearer token value in each request to the API. The token will continue to be valid until it is revoked. If access to additional resources is requested or if access to a resource is removed, the same access token can still be used after authorization to the resource is granted or removed.
-H "Authorization: Bearer 7de937e1-8574-4459-a0cc-bb4505e7803f"

Versioning
The initial release of Tekmetric's API will be versioned as v1. All endpoints will include the API version as part of it's URL path, for example:  https://sandbox.tekmetric.com/api/v1/customers. Future releases to the Tekmetric API that include breaking changes will use a different version in it's URL path.

Environments
Tekmetric provides both a Test and Production environment for it's public API. We encourage users to use the Test environment to experiment with and develop against.

Environment	Hostname
Sandbox	https://sandbox.tekmetric.com
Production	https://shop.tekmetric.com

Error Responses
Tekmetric uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. Tekmetric will return 200, 4xx, and 5xx status codes.
HTTP Status Code	Description
200	Everything worked as expected
400	Bad request. Request has invalid parameters.
401	Unauthorized. Invalid client credentials or access token provided.
403	Forbidden. Provided access token does not have sufficient privileges to requested resource.
404	Requested resource not found.
429	Too many requests. Rate limit exceeded.
5xx	Error on Tekmetric's end.
Error Types	Description
invalid_token	Invalid access token provided to API.
insufficient_scope	Provided access token does not have sufficient privileges to requested resource.
invalid_client	Invalid client credentials or grant type provided to API.


Example Error Response
{
  "error": "insufficient_scope",
  "error_description": "Insufficient scope for this resource",
  "scope": "791"
}
Rate Limiting
Our API enforces rate limits to maintain optimal performance and prevent abuse. The default limit is 600 requests per minute. Sandbox accounts are limited to 300 API calls per minute. To avoid disruptions:

Avoid Burst Traffic: Distribute your requests evenly over time rather than sending large bursts.
Consequences of Repeated Bursting: Repeatedly exceeding the rate limit may lead to further restrictions on your API usage.
If you are querying a large amount of data within a short timeframe, the API's response code will indicate that you've exceeded the quota available for your API Key by returning an HTTP status code 429 and an empty body.

Handling 429 errors
When you hit the rate limit, you will receive a 429 Too Many Requests response. Here’s how to handle it gracefully:

Implement Exponential Backoff: Retry requests with increasing wait times between attempts to prevent overwhelming the server.
Monitor Your Usage: Keep track of your request rate and adjust your application to stay within the limits.
Optimize Requests: Cache responses and avoid redundant requests to reduce the load on the API.
For more advanced handling, consider implementing a token bucket algorithm on the client-side. This method allows you to control the rate of requests by using tokens that are replenished over time.

Exponential Backoff
Exponential backoff is a common strategy for handling rate limits and network congestion. It works by increasing the wait time between retries after each failed request, up to a maximum limit. This approach helps prevent overwhelming the server with repeated requests.

Here’s how exponential backoff works:

Make a request to the API.
If the request fails, wait 2 + random_number_milliseconds seconds and retry the request.
If the request fails, wait 4 + random_number_milliseconds seconds and retry the request.
If the request fails, wait 8 + random_number_milliseconds seconds and retry the request.
And so on, up to a maximum_backoff time.
Continue waiting and retrying up to some maximum number of retries, but do not increase the wait period between retries.
Where:

The wait time is min(((2^n)+random_number_milliseconds), maximum_backoff), with n incremented by 1 for each iteration (request), and starting with n=1.
random_number_milliseconds is a random number of milliseconds less than or equal to 1000.
maximum_backoff is typically 60 seconds.

IMPORTANT: Repair Orders API Query Parameter Behavior
============================================================================
CRITICAL FINDING: When querying the /api/v1/repair-orders endpoint, combining 
regular date parameters (start/end) with deleted date parameters 
(deletedDateStart/deletedDateEnd) causes the API to return ONLY deleted records,
not both active and deleted records as might be expected.

Confirmed Behavior (tested October 16, 2025):
1. Using only 'start' and 'end' parameters returns ACTIVE repair orders only
2. Using 'deletedDateStart' and 'deletedDateEnd' parameters returns DELETED records only  
3. Using BOTH sets of parameters together returns ONLY DELETED records (not both)

This behavior requires separate API calls to get both active and deleted records:
- Call 1: Use start/end or updatedDateStart/updatedDateEnd for active/updated records
- Call 2: Use deletedDateStart/deletedDateEnd for deleted records
- Merge results in application code

For incremental syncs, use updatedDateStart/updatedDateEnd instead of start/end 
to catch records that were modified (not just created) within the time window.

This finding explains why sync processes might only capture deleted records when
trying to include both active and deleted records in a single API call.
